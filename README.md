what will the future look like?
it always fascinates me n Keeps me curious.
when i started this project i was like,
ENOUGH, THINKING WILL ONLY GET ME SO FAR
LETS TRY TO DRAW IT!
so i sketched my perspective on the future,
the buildings would be flying mid air, 
thwre might not be a suitable weather so atmosphereic sheilds
might be used n ofc everyone's fantasy, flying cars
n roads! 
hope you like it
